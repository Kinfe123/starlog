## Introduction

Dub is an open-source link management tool for modern marketing teams to create, share, and track short links. Built with [Vercel Edge Functions](http://vercel.com/edge), [Upstash Redis](https://docs.upstash.com/redis), and [Planetscale MySQL](https://planetscale.com/).

Here are some of the features that Dub provides out-of-the-box:

### Built-in Analytics

Dub provides a powerful analytics dashboard for your links, including geolocation, device, and browser information.

### Custom domains

You can easily configure custom domains on Dub – just add an A/CNAME record to your DNS provider and you're good to go. This is built on the [Vercel Domains API](https://domains-api.vercel.app/).

### QR Code Generator

You can easily generate and customize QR codes for your links, which can be used for flyers, posters, powerpoint presentations, etc.

### OG Image Proxy

Add a custom OG image in front of your target URL. Bots like Twitter/Facebook will be served this image, while users will be redirected to your target URL.

## Deploy Your Own

> Note: one-click deployment is a bit broken at the moment – you'll need to change some of the hard-coded values in the codebase to get it working. We're working on fixing this.

You can deploy your own hosted version of Dub for greater privacy & control. Just click the link below to deploy a ready-to-go version of Dub to Vercel.

## Implementation

Dub is built as a standard Next.js application with [Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/middleware) to handle multi-tenancy, inspired by [the Vercel Platforms Starter Kit](https://github.com/vercel/platforms).

[Redis](https://redis.io/) is used as the caching layer for all short links.

[Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.com/) ([Tinybird](https://tinybird.com/)) is used as the analytics database for storing link click data.

[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) is used as the database for storing user data, project data, and link metadata. You can refer to the Prisma schema [here](/prisma/schema.prisma).
