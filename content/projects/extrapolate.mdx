Note that you'll need to set up a [ReplicateHQ](https://replicate.com) account and [Upstash](https://upstash.com) account to get the required environment variables.

You'll also need to create a [Cloudflare R2 instance](https://www.cloudflare.com/lp/pg-r2/) and set up a Cloudflare Worker to handle uploads & reads (will add more instructions on this soon).
